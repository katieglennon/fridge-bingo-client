# Fridge Bingo

## Overview

Fridge Bingo encourages users to be resourceful and creative in the kitchen in a bid to combat food waste. The aim make cooking more accessible and fun by using random or leftover ingredients that they already have at home in order to create a delicious meal.

### Problem Space

I like to experiment with new recipes but I lack the imagination or knowledge of what I could do with the half-used vegetables, sauces, or ingredients leftover in my fridge that I would ideally like to save before they spoil and go to landfill.

In a busy world of convenience and cost saving having a simple tool to help utilise what ingredients you have available at home would be benefit those that want to live sustainably and do not have the time for frequent grocery shopping or detailed meal planning. Maximise what you have to minimise food waste!
